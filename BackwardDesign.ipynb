    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "This project is an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of policy on the opioid crisis in America. Over the past two decades, America has seen a sharp increase in opioid use, addiction, and related deaths. It is important to evaluate the impact of policy implementation to ensure that we are iteratively approaching positive change in our society. Without reflective evaluation, policies have a subjective impact, are susceptible to politicization, and may not be effective in addressing the problem at hand. In this evaluation, we will seek both to understand the effectiveness of policy implementation and to establish a framework for future policy evaluation."

    "# Question Definition\n",
    "The analysis of policies aimed at the opioid crisis aims to answer two key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What effect does opioid drug regulation have on the volume of opioid prescriptions? \n",
    "2. What effect does opioid drug regulation have on the number of opioid-related deaths?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two output variables we will examine are the volume of opioid prescriptions (shipments) and opioid-related deaths. We will investigate how policies impact these two variables."

    "## Policy Outlines:\n",
    "* Florida (2010): In 2010, Florida was home to 98 of the 100 U.S. physicians who dispensed the highest quantities of oxycodone directly from their offices. In February 2010, the Drug Enforcement Administration and various Florida law enforcement agencies began to work together in Operation Pill Nation. Operation Pill Nation was an edeavor to crack down on rogue pain clinics and 'pill mills' which were distributing opioids in large quantities. There were a series of policy evolutions here but they are referenced as having occured in February of 2010. Additional milestones of interest are the declaration of a public health emergency by the Florida Surgeon General, the prohibition of physician dispensing of Schedule II and III drugs, and the implementation of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).\n",
    "* Texas (2007): Texas Medical Board adopted regulations for the treatment of pain with controlled substances which included:\n",
    "    * Perfroming a patient evaluation before prescribing opioids including a review of prescription history.\n",
    "    * Obtaining informed consent from the patient for opioid treatment.\n",
    "    * Conducting periodic reviews of the patient's progress with a complete medical recod of treatment. \n",
    "* Washington (2012): In 2012, Washington State enacted regulations for the prescribing of opioids which included requirements that must be met prior to the prescription of opioids to a patient:\n",
    "    * For stable patients involving non-escalating doses (daily) of 40mg per day or less. Annual review of the patient's treatment required.\n",
    "    * For patients who would recieve 120mg per day, a mandatory consultation is required.\n",
    "    * If there is a prescription above the consultation threshold, a consultation with a pain management specialist is required.\n",
    "    * The physician must document all consultations.\n",
    "    * Prescription above the 120mg is not recommended for patients demonstrating improvement in function or without first obtaining a consultation with a pain management specialist."
